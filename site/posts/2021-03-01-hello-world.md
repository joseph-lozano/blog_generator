Ok, the description says "My very first post", and we all now that isn't quite true. I have written before. On [dev.to](https://dev.to/joseph_lozano), and on previous iterations of this website.

Will this be the time I keep it up? I hope so. There are many benefits to blogging.

So what will I write about? Who knows. I primarily program in Elixir and Phoenix. I think that these are two programming languages that will continue to grow in popularity over time. Perhaps I can leverage that...ðŸ¤”
