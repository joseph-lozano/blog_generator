I just redeployted one my side-projects. It is an Elixir implementation of the [Schulze Voting Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method)

It is pretty complete, even having user registration and sending emails to confirm.

This project was written entirely by me. It is written in (big surprise) Elixir/Phoenix, with the Phoenix LiveView for flair. Styling is done with Bootstrap (though I'd like to convert this to TailwindCSS... not sure when/if that will ever happen)

It's deployed right now to [schulze.vote](https://schulze.vote). Neat domain name, if I do say so myself.
If you are in from the distant future, and I've suspended the app, just shoot me an email at the address at the top of this page, and I'll be happy to spin it back up.

You can also check out the source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/joseph-lozano/schulze).

Comments/feedback are appreciated. Just shoot me an email.

Thanks for reading.
