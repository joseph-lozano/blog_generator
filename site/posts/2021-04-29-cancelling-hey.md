On April 26, I cancelled my [HEY](https://hey.com) account. I was one of the very first customers of HEY. So early, in fact, that I was able to snag joseph@hey.com.

I had been a fan of the company behind HEY, Basecamp, for some time. Things I liked about Basecamp:

1. They are behind [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org), a wildly popular web framework, and the first web framework I worked with.
2. They pay their employees well. Despite being remote, they paid the [90th percentile](https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-we-pay-people-at-basecamp/) of Silicon Valley salaries. They were also transparent about all their salaries.
3. They were vocal about [rejecting the VC](https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-much-is-basecamp-worth-i-dont-know-and-i-dont-care/) mentalitaly of un-restrained growth.

HEY itself was a very interesting project. I liked some things (the Screener), didn't like others (search).

Ultimately though, the reason I am canceling is because of what happened this week.

On Monday, Jason, the CEO of Basecamp, [announced a set of policy changes](https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5) at the company. These changes included:

1. No more societal and political discussions at Basecamp.
2. No more paternalistic benefits.
3. No more committees.
4. No more lingering or dwelling on past decisions.
5. No more 360 reviews.
6. No forgetting what we do here.

Read Jason's post for his reasoning and more detail on what each of these mean. Later, DHH, the CTO and co-owner of Basecamp, also [weighed in](https://world.hey.com/dhh/basecamp-s-new-etiquette-regarding-societal-politics-at-work-b44bef69)

When I first read Jason's post, I was floored. Shocked. I did not expect anything like that to come out of Basecamp. Basecamp the company, and DHH, constantly injected themselves into societal and politcal discussion, from their [books about the state of modern work](https://basecamp.com/books), and how to run a better business, to their [stand against Apple](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1272968382329942017) and other tech monopolies.

Later reporting by Casey Newton showed [what really happened at Basecamp](https://www.platformer.news/p/-what-really-happened-at-basecamp). In short: Jason and DHH felt that employee discussions about an inappropriate list of customer's names distracted from getting actual work done. Employess had "sought to advance Basecamp’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion by having sensitive discussions about the company’s own failures" but Jason and DHH did not liek that, and shut those discussions down.

This is further proven by the dissolution of the company's DEI committee, which almost a third of the company had joined.

Many might feel tempted to react by saying that, like a Thanksgiving dinner, religion and politics do not belong at work. But we must ask, "what politics". DHH, as far as I can see, has never answered this question. Employees have: "politcs" means pointing out faults in their company in an effort to help it grow, especially in areas of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.

Employees are now given a severance option if they wish to leave the company. It is still unknown what strings it comes with.

Reflecting on all this, I think the real sin is that Jason and DHH think that Basecamp is _their_ company. That they are the deciders and shapers of the company cultuer. On paper, the company does belong to them. But the culture is not theirs. The culture belongs to the employees, and when you look at how current and former employees reacted to this news, you get the real story.

1. [I don't agree with the changes announced today, and I'm sad & upset.](https://mobile.twitter.com/jonasdowney/status/1386792772334768130)
2. [I would be worse off as a person... had these new company policies been in place for the last 7 years.](https://mobile.twitter.com/conormuirhead/status/1386773076990324738)
3. [Yikes.](https://mobile.twitter.com/taramann/status/1386761458868908032)
4. [The reality of working at Basecamp for anyone other than Jason and David has been far messier than the image they’ve crafted for some time.](https://mobile.twitter.com/georgeclaghorn/status/1386998266026471424)
5. [In my entire professional career of 20+ years, I have never once cried at work until today.](https://mobile.twitter.com/dankim)
6. [Jason and David, I believe that your recent company policy changes are both terrible and redeemable.](https://janeyang.org/2021/04/27/an-open-letter-to-jason-and-david/)

I want to believe that these changes are redeemable, but DHH and Jason keep [doubling](https://world.hey.com/dhh/mosaics-of-positions-ae6d4d9e), [tripling](https://world.hey.com/jason/on-making-decisions-fb7adfbf), and [quadrupling](https://world.hey.com/dhh/let-it-all-out-78485e8e) down.

Until they recognize that company culture is not their own plaything, but something that belongs to all employees, I can not in good conscience support such a company.
