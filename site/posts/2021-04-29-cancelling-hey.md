On April 26, I cancelled my [HEY](https://hey.com) account. I was one of the very first customers of HEY. So early, in fact, that I was able to snag joseph@hey.com.

I can no longer support the company behind HEY, though. And so I have cancelled my account.
I can new be reached at [me@josephlozano.xyz](mailto:blog@josephlozano.xyz)
